# WoolBattle
WoolBattle Plugin for  Pocketmine (pmmp)

<b>How to Install</b>

Download TeaSpoon for your server and an Entchantment Plugin like PiggyCustomEntchants, then Download fCore, it will setup everything for you!

<b>Dont forget to install the EloSystem from my Github! Also be sure and check if all the worlds exit that u will need, you will need a world called lobby and woolbattle worlds (woolbattle, woolbattle2, woolbattle3, etc.). You need to set the spawns of the world using /cloud/maps/woolconfig.yml !</b>
